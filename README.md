Before, you begin accessing the files and the code for the authentication app, make sure you follow these prelimenary steps:



Step 1.) Once you create your new studio project go to Tools>Fireblaze, this will open up the Google Fireblaze support authenticator(which will be needed to add the Google Auth to your app).

Step2.)Once you have the support menu on the right open, click on the third point, Authentication and then click on the small link that says "Email and Password Authentication"

Step3.)After you click on the small link,it will redirect you to a set of few steps,you only need to worry about the first one, which connects Firebase to your app.

(Before we proceed, make sure to only use one email for both firebase and your android studio, it is key to linking firebase to your app)

Step4.)Now once you have connected firebase to your app, go to https://firebase.google.com, sign into the same account you used for Android studio. Then click on go to console. If firebase has successfully connected to your app, your app should show up on the console, if it is not on the console follow previous steps again.

Step5.)Then click on "develop" on the right side, and then click on authentication

Step6.)In authentication, click on the Sign-In method.The scroll down to where it says Google Sign in, click enable and then put it an email in the support part. Then click save.
